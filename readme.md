Here, I will be writting code according to the tutorials. Each tutorial have a new branch which is created from previous branch.

Example -> The first tutorial is on ES6, and then we go towards next lecture. So whatever we do in ES6 lecture, we commit in that branch and next branch starts from that same state/position.

Branches are named with numbers for easy identification

IMP
NO MERGING IN MASTER BRANCH BOTH LOCALLY AND ALSO IN REMOTE
